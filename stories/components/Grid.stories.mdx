# Grid

Grids create consistency between layouts while allowing flexibility across different viewports.

The grid system is implemented with the `Grid` component:

- There are two types: containers and items
- It uses flexbox for simplicity
- Item widths are percentage based
Items have padding to create the spacing between individual items.
There are five grid breakpoints: xs, sm, md, lg, and xl.
