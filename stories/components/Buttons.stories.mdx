# Buttons

Buttons allow users to take actions, and make choices, with a single tap

## Usage

Buttons communicate actions that users can take. They are typically placed throughout your UI, in places like:

- Dialogs
- Modal windows
- Forms
- Cards
- Toolbars

### Text Labels

Text buttons and contained buttons use text labels, which describe the action that will occur if a user taps a button. If a text label is not used, an icon should be present to signify what the button does.

By default Neutron uses capitalized button text labels (for languages that have capitalization). This is to distinguish the text label from surrounding text. If a text button does not use capitalization for button text, find another characteristic to distinguish it such as color, size, or placement.

### Filled Buttons

Filled buttons are high-emphasis, distinguished by their use of elevation and fill. They contain actions that are primary to your app.

<Story name="filled buttons">
  {createButtonDemo()}
</Story>

### Soft Buttons

<Story name="soft buttons">
  {createButtonDemo({ soft: true })}
</Story>

### Outlined Buttons

<Story name="outlined buttons">
  {createButtonDemo({ outline: true })}
</Story>


### Rounded Buttons

<Story name="rounded buttons">
  {createButtonDemo({ rounded: true })}
</Story>

## Button Props

<Props of={Button} />
